        'kind of fishing hook. But it has recently starting selling a new kind of ' +
        'hook that allows people to catch many more fish than they would with the ' + 
        'older hook. </p> <p> There are 20 people who regularly fish in Lake Wilson ' +
        'during the summer. If 7 or more people started using the new hook for ' +
        'fishing, then by the end of the summer, the entire fish population would ' +
